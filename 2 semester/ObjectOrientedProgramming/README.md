Projects from "object oriented programming" (Programowanie obiektowe).
All of them are written in java. According to it's name the subject was all about object oriented programming.
Here are two projects that were required to do pass the labs - "Matrices" and "Bajt Trade".
# Matrices
Matrices calculator that can add one matrice to another, multiply them or calculate one's norm in One or in Infinity.
The whole project is object oriented so there are few subclasses to standard matrix class (with a 2d array).
For example we have diagonal matrix that only has values (other than zero) on the diagonal.
Of course if we add one diagonal matrix to another we will get a diagonal matrix.
# Bajt Trade
Program that given input in JSON simulates stock market.
